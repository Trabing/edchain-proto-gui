### Notes

Pulling filler content for the mock-up from here (engineering --> computer science --> theory of computation):

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=engineering&subcat=computerscience&spec=theoryofcomputation

---

going down the page, but skipping the second 6.034 course listed becase it has the same course ID as the previous listing

---

multi-core programming has a couple of unordered list items and it made me realize that I'm not going to be preserving that sense of structure in the mock-up. maybe we should use mongo or postgres to store mark-up to preserve the style?

---

skipping "Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science" because of string interpolation issue
